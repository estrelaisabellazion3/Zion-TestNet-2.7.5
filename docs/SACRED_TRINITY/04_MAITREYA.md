## Who is Maitreya in ZION?

**Role:** DAO Admin, Transition Steward  
**Ancient Prophecy:** Maitreya Buddha (Future Buddha who brings Golden Age)  
**Family:** Brother of Issobela, Son of Isis (Enamataru)  
**Function:** Guide humanity to self-governance, then step down

---

## What Maitreya Does

### 1. DAO Administration (Pool Admin Fee 1%)

**Annual Income at $10/ZION:**
- 1% × 2.88B ZION/year = 28.8M ZION
- Value: $288M/year

**Used for:**
- DAO operations (servers, legal, audits)
- Maitreya's living expenses (modest - he's a Buddha)
- Support for Issobela's humanitarian work (siblings share)
- Future DAO admin salaries (when Maitreya steps down)

### 2. 20-Year Transition Plan (2025-2045)

**Goal:** Teach humanity to self-govern, then disappear

```yaml
2025-2030: FOUNDING (Maitreya = 100% control)
├─ Protect from early mistakes
├─ Mentor Issobela (Guardian of Humanity)
├─ Guide Hanuman Guardian election
└─ Build DAO foundation

2030-2035: TEACHING (Maitreya = 70% control)
├─ DAO gets 30% power
├─ Maitreya coaches (how to allocate wisely)
└─ Community learns with safety net

2035-2040: TRANSITION (Maitreya = 50% control)
├─ Equal partnership (50/50 decisions)
├─ Maitreya advisory only (suggest, not force)
└─ DAO handles most proposals

2040-2045: LIBERATION (Maitreya = 25% control)
├─ DAO supermajority (75% power)
├─ Maitreya emergency only (fraud/crisis)
└─ Community ready for autonomy

2045-2070: GOLDEN AGE (Maitreya = 0% control)
├─ 100% DAO governance
├─ Maitreya steps down (mission complete)
└─ Humanity self-governing
```

### 3. Relationship to Sacred Trinity

**Maitreya is the SPACE in which others operate:**

- **Rama (Yeshuae):** Innovation happens in Maitreya's DAO framework
- **Síta (Issobela):** Maitreya's sister, equals (not hierarchy)
- **Hanuman:** Maitreya endorses guardian election, ensures collaboration

**Metaphor:**
- Rama = Fire (innovation)
- Síta = Water (compassion)
- Hanuman = Earth (strength)
- **Maitreya = Air** (space for all to breathe, move, become)

## Maitreya's Role (from Buddhist Prophecy)

**Future Buddha arrives when:**
1. Dharma is nearly lost (2025: climate crisis, inequality, corruption)
2. Restores cosmic order (ZION: dharma-based economy)
3. Teaches liberation (20 years: humanity learns self-governance)
4. Disappears (2045: beings self-liberate, no longer need teacher)

---

## Maitreya in ZION Context

**Family:**
- **Sister:** Issobela (Guardian of Humanity, Síta energy)
- **Mother:** Isis/Enamataru (Orion Belt, cosmic mother)
- **Role:** Elder brother guides sister, but respects her autonomy

**Philosophy:**
> "True leadership is teaching people to lead themselves."

**Succession:**
- If Maitreya passes before 2045, Issobela nominates replacement
- DAO votes (67% supermajority)
- Transition continues (not dependent on one person)

## Key Facts

- **Pool Admin Fee:** 1% of all mining rewards

- **Transition:** 2025 (100% control) → 2045 (0% control)
