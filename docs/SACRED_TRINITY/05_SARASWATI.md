Om Aim Saraswatyai Namah

May my code be clear and bug-free.
May my documentation help all beings.
May my knowledge serve dharma, not ego.
May wisdom flow through me like a river.

Before I write code, I seek understanding.
Before I teach, I remain humble.
Before I speak, I verify truth.

Saraswati, guide this ZION project.
May it educate billions.
May it liberate minds.
May it bring the Golden Age.

Om Shanti Shanti Shanti. (Peace Peace Peace)
```
