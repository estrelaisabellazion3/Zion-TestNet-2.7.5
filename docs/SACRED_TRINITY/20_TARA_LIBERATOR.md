## üå∏ The Origin Story of Tara

### The Tears of Avalokiteshvara

**Ancient Buddhist Legend:**

> Avalokiteshvara (Bodhisattva of Compassion) looked upon the suffering of all beings in the six realms. He wept for countless eons, his tears forming a lake.
>
> From that lake of compassion, **a lotus bloomed**.
>
> From the lotus emerged **Tara**, fully enlightened, ready to act.

**She spoke her vow:**

> *"Just as there are many Buddhas who manifest in male form, I shall work for the welfare of beings in female form until samsara is emptied."*

**Revolutionary Statement:**
- First major female Buddha in Mahayana Buddhism
- Challenged patriarchal Buddhist norms
- Proved: Enlightenment has no gender
- Inspired women practitioners for 1,500+ years
