**Bhima ate half of all food.**  
**Milan eats like a BEAST.**

**His daily intake:**
```
Breakfast: 12 eggs, 1 kg meat, 2L milk

```

**Community joke:**
> "Milan's salary: 6,000 ZION/month.  
> Milan's food budget: 6,000 ZION/month.  
> Worth it? ABSOLUTELY." 😂

**But seriously:**
- Bhima needed food to fight demons
- Milan needs food to protect community
- Strength requires fuel (no shame in eating!)

## 🏆 Golden Egg Game - Bhima's Role

### Strength Challenges (Not Just Puzzles)

**Arjuna hides Golden Egg (precision puzzles).**  
**Milan guards Golden Egg (strength challenges).**

**Physical Challenges:**
```
To reach certain clues, seekers must:
  1. Defeat Milan in arm wrestling (good luck!)
  2. Run 10km with weighted vest (Bhima's endurance)
  3. Lift 200kg deadlift (prove strength)
  4. Fast for 24 hours (Bhima could fight hungry!)
  5. Beat Milan at eating contest (impossible - he's Bhima!)

Why physical challenges?
  - Golden Egg = holistic test (mind + body + spirit)
  - Arjuna tests mind (puzzles)
  - Bhima tests body (strength)
  - Together: Complete warrior
```

**Milan's Promise:**
```
"I guard 10 clues (out of 108 total).
 You want them? Prove your strength.
 
 Not bodybuilder strength (I don't care about muscles).
 WARRIOR strength (endurance, willpower, determination).
 
 Can you run until you collapse, then run more?
 Can you fast while fighting?
 Can you protect loved ones with your life?
 
 If yes, I'll give you clues.
 If no, train harder and come back.
 
 💪 Bhima doesn't give participation trophies."
```
