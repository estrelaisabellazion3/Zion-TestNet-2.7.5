### 4. Hanuman's Sacred Oath

```
I accept the mantle of Hanuman.

I will serve nature with strength.
I will protect species who cannot speak.
I will move mountains if dharma requires.
I will honor Síta (children) by ensuring they inherit a living planet.

Jai Hanuman! (Victory to the Servant!)
```

## Hanuman in ZION Context

**Partnership with Issobela (Síta):**
- Issobela builds schools → Hanuman plants trees for shade

- Together: Healthy planet + healthy children = Golden Age

**Philosophy:**
> "Serve the Earth as if your life depends on it. Because it does."
