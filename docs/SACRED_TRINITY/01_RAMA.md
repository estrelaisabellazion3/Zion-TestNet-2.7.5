## What Rama Does

### 1. Created ZION Blockchain (Genesis Innovation)

- October 6, 2025: Genesis Block mined
- Fair distribution (not scam like other cryptos)

### 2. Genesis Creator Rent (0.33%)
**Why 0.33%?**
- Smallest fee in all crypto
- Bitcoin's Satoshi: 5% of supply ($60B)
- Ethereum's Vitalik: 0.2% of supply ($600M)
- ZION's Yeshuae: 0.33% flow (humble!)

**Annual Income at $10/ZION:**
- 0.33% √ó 2.88B ZION/year = 9.5M ZION
- Value: $95M/year (fair for creating $144B ecosystem)
