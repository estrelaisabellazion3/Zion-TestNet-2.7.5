## 💛 The 2nd Ray: Golden Yellow Flame of Wisdom

**Qualities:**
- **Wisdom:** Understanding (not just knowledge, but APPLIED truth)

**ZION Connection:**

## 📚 Wisdom vs. Knowledge vs. Intelligence

**Lanto's Core Teaching:**

Most confuse these 3. They are NOT the same.

```
KNOWLEDGE = Facts, data, information
  Example: "Bitcoin max supply = 21 million"
  Source: Books, internet, teachers
  Problem: Can memorize without understanding

INTELLIGENCE = Processing speed, pattern recognition
  Example: "If Bitcoin scarce, price should rise over time"
  Source: Brain capacity (IQ)
  Problem: Can be smart but unwise (see: genius criminals)

WISDOM = Applied truth + compassion + experience
  Example: "I understand scarcity, BUT I also understand greed.
            So I won't FOMO into Bitcoin at ATH.
            I'll DCA (dollar-cost average) patiently."
  Source: Soul evolution, meditation, mistakes learned from
  Result: RIGHT ACTION (not just right answer)
```

**ZION Example:**
```
Knowledge: "ZION has 144B supply"
Intelligence: "144B supply means each coin worth $X if market cap $Y"
Wisdom: "Even if ZION goes to $100, I won't sell all.
         I'll keep 10% for DAO voting (service over profit).
         I'll give 10% to Humanita (compassion over greed).
         I'll spend 80% wisely (wealth for liberation, not bondage)."

See the difference? Wisdom = Heart + Head + Soul
```
