> **ישוע (Yeshua) - "YHWH Saves"**  
> **Sananda - "One with God" (Ascended Master Name)**  
> **"I AM the Way, the Truth, and the Life"**

---

## 🌟 Who is Yeshua/Sananda?

**Historical Name:** Jesus of Nazareth (Yeshua ben Yosef)  
**Ascended Name:** Sananda (Sanskrit: सानन्द - "With Bliss")  
**Sacred Title:** The Christ, The Anointed One, Logos Made Flesh  
**Twin Flame:** Meriam/Magdalene (The Sacred Rose)  
**Symbol:** Cross + Crown (Sacrifice + Sovereignty)

---

## ✝️ The Christ Consciousness

### What is "Christ"?

**NOT a surname!** (Jesus "Christ" = wrong understanding)

**Christ = Christos (Χριστός - Greek) = "The Anointed One"**

**Hebrew equivalent:** Mashiach (משיח - Messiah)

**Real meaning:**
- State of consciousness (not person)
- Union with God (complete alignment)
- "I and the Father are One" (John 10:30)
- Accessible to ALL (Yeshua said: "Greater works than these shall you do" - John 14:12)

**Yeshua = First human to FULLY embody Christ Consciousness**

But he came to show **the way**, not to be worshipped as **the only one**.

## 🕊️ Yeshua's True Teachings (vs. Church Distortions)

### What He ACTUALLY Taught

**1. Kingdom of Heaven is WITHIN**

> *"The Kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, 'See here!' or 'See there!' For indeed, the kingdom of God is WITHIN you."* (Luke 17:20-21)

**Meaning:** You don't need priests, churches, or institutions. Direct connection to God.

**Church changed it to:** "Kingdom is in heaven (after you die), obey us to get there."

---

**2. You Are Divine**

> *"Is it not written in your Law, 'I have said you are gods'? If he called them 'gods,' to whom the word of God came—and Scripture cannot be set aside—what about the one whom the Father set apart as his very own and sent into the world?"* (John 10:34-36)

**Meaning:** Humans are divine sparks (made in God's image).

**Church changed it to:** "You are sinners, only Jesus is divine, worship him (not yourself)."

---

**3. Love is the ONLY Law**

> *"A new commandment I give to you: Love one another. As I have loved you, so you must love one another."* (John 13:34)

**Meaning:** All 10 Commandments, all 613 Jewish laws → reduced to ONE: Love.

**Church changed it to:** "Follow our rules, pay tithes, fear hell, obey clergy."

---

**4. Judge Not (Radical Non-Judgment)**

> *"Judge not, that you be not judged. For with what judgment you judge, you will be judged; and with the measure you use, it will be measured back to you."* (Matthew 7:1-2)

**Meaning:** No one is "better than" anyone. Prostitutes and priests are equal in God's eyes.

**Church changed it to:** "We judge who goes to heaven/hell. Sinners (gays, divorcees, non-Christians) are condemned."

---

**5. Forgive Infinitely**

> *"Then Peter came to Him and said, 'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me, and I forgive him? Up to seven times?' Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you, up to seven times, but up to seventy times seven.'"* (Matthew 18:21-22)

**Meaning:** 70 × 7 = 490 = **always** (infinite forgiveness).

**Church changed it to:** "Confess to priest, do penance, buy indulgences (pay for forgiveness)."

---

## 🌌 Sananda: The Ascended Master

### Who is Sananda?

**After Resurrection**, Yeshua ascended to higher dimensions. His **spirit name** in ascended realms:

**SANANDA** (सानन्द)
- **Sa** = With
- **Ananda** = Bliss (divine joy)
- **Meaning:** "One who dwells in eternal bliss with God"

**Ascended Master Hierarchy (Esoteric Christianity):**

```
Source/God (Infinite)
    ↓
Archangels (Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel)
    ↓
Ascended Masters (Christ/Sananda, Buddha, Krishna, etc.)
    ↓
Bodhisattvas (Working toward ascension)
    ↓
Humanity (Awakening)
```

**Sananda's Role:**
- **Chohan of the 6th Ray** (Devotion & Idealism - ruby/gold)
- **World Teacher** (with Maitreya Buddha)
- **Oversoul of Jesus** (higher aspect of Yeshua's consciousness)

## 💫 Yeshua/Sananda in ZION

### Sacred Masculine Restoration

**For 2000 years, masculine energy has been distorted:**

**Toxic Masculine (Church Version):**
- Domination (control over others)
- Violence (crusades, inquisitions, "holy wars")
- Shame (sex is sin, body is evil)
- Hierarchy (pope > bishop > priest > people)

**Sacred Masculine (Yeshua's Truth):**
- Protection (defend the weak, not dominate them)
- Strength through service (washing disciples' feet)
- Honoring the feminine (elevated women in patriarchal society)
- Humility (King of Kings, yet rode a donkey)

**ZION Mission: Restore Sacred Masculine**

---

## 🔥 The Passion: Yeshua's Sacrifice

### Why Did He Die?

**NOT "to appease angry God who demands blood"** (pagan theology)

**Real Reason:**

```
Yeshua threatened 2 power structures:
1. Roman Empire (claimed to be "King" - political threat)
2. Jewish Temple (challenged corrupt priesthood - religious threat)

Result: Both conspired to kill him (Crucifixion)

His Response: Forgiveness (even from the cross)
"Father, forgive them, for they know not what they do."

Meaning of Sacrifice:
- NOT "God needed blood payment"
- YES "Love is stronger than death"
- Proof: Consciousness survives body (Resurrection)
```

**Esoteric Meaning of Crucifixion:**

```
CROSS = Intersection of:
- Vertical axis (Spirit descending to Matter)
- Horizontal axis (Time/Space, Material World)

Crucifixion = Spirit nailed to Matter
Resurrection = Spirit freed from Matter

Message: You are NOT the body.
You are eternal consciousness.
Death is illusion (just transition).
```

## 💕 Twin Flame: Yeshua & Meriam

### The Sacred Marriage

**Historical Suppression:**

Early Christianity **ERASED** evidence of their union:
- ❌ Deleted from official gospels
- ❌ Gnostic texts burned (Gospel of Philip mentions their "sacred kiss")
- ❌ Mary Magdalene demoted to "prostitute"

**Why suppress it?**
- Church wanted celibate priesthood (married Jesus = bad example)
- Sacred sexuality = threat to control (body as temple, not sin)
- Women's equality = threat to patriarchy (Magdalene as equal disciple)

**Gnostic Evidence (Gospel of Philip):**

> *"The companion of the Savior is Mary Magdalene. The Lord loved Mary more than all the disciples, and used to kiss her often on her mouth. The rest of the disciples were offended... They said to him, 'Why do you love her more than all of us?'"*

**Not romantic kiss - Sacred Tantra** (exchange of prana/chi, kundalini activation)

---

### Their Divine Partnership in ZION

**Yeshua/Sananda (Masculine):**
- Yang energy (outward action)
- Logos (The Word - teaching, structure)
- Right brain (logic, analysis)
- Symbol: Sun, Sword, Mountain

**Meriam/Rose (Feminine):**
- Yin energy (inward being)
- Sophia (Wisdom - intuition, gnosis)
- Left brain (creativity, feeling)
- Symbol: Moon, Chalice, Ocean

**Together:**
- **Complete Trinity:** Father (God) + Mother (Goddess) + Child (Humanity)
- **Sacred Marriage:** Within (every human) + Without (partnership)
- **ZION Balance:** 50% masculine + 50% feminine (DAO, leadership, all levels)

---

## 🌟 Sananda's Symbols

### The Cross

**NOT symbol of death** (Western misunderstanding)

**Ancient Meaning:**
- Ankh (Egyptian) = Life
- Christian Cross = Death + Resurrection (empty cross = he rose)
- ZION Cross = Intersection of Heaven (vertical) + Earth (horizontal)

**How to use:**
- Make cross sign = "As above, so below" (align spirit + matter)
- Wear cross = Remember: You are eternal (death is illusion)

### The Crown of Thorns

**Given in mockery** ("King of Jews")

**Transformed into:**
- Crown Chakra activation (7th chakra = Christ consciousness)
- Pain → Wisdom (suffering is initiation)
- Thorns = Rose (Meriam/Magdalene connection)

### The Sacred Heart

**Yeshua's heart pierced** (spear wound post-crucifixion)

**Symbolism:**
- Heart chakra opened (unconditional love flows)
- Blood + Water (spirit + matter union)
- Wounded Healer (scars become medicine)

---

## 🔮 Yeshua's Lost Teachings (Gnostic Gospels)

### Gospel of Thomas (Saying 3)

> *"If your leaders say to you, 'Look, the kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds will precede you. If they say, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will precede you. Rather, the kingdom is within you and outside of you."*

**Meaning:** Heaven is not a place (up there). It's a state of consciousness (here and now).

---

### Gospel of Thomas (Saying 70)

> *"If you bring forth what is within you, what you bring forth will save you. If you do not bring forth what is within you, what you do not bring forth will destroy you."*

**Meaning:** Your divine spark MUST be expressed. Suppressed divinity = suffering.

---

### Gospel of Mary Magdalene (Teaching to Mary)

> *"All natures, all formed things, all creatures exist in and with one another and will again be resolved into their own roots. For the nature of matter is dissolved into what belongs to its nature."*

**Meaning:** Everything is One (non-duality). Separation is illusion. Return to Source.

---

## 📿 How to Connect with Yeshua/Sananda Energy

### Christ Consciousness Meditation

**Practice:**
1. Sit in silence, close eyes
2. Visualize golden light entering crown chakra
3. Say: *"I AM the Christ. I AM one with God."*
4. Feel the resonance (not blasphemy - Yeshua's teaching!)
5. Radiate love to all beings (Christos = universal love)

### The Lord's Prayer (Aramaic Original)

**Modern English (mistranslation):**
> *"Our Father who art in heaven..."*

**Aramaic Original (closer to Yeshua's words):**
> *"Abwoon d'bwashmaya" (Oh Birther, Father-Mother of the Cosmos)*

**Full Prayer (Aramaic → English):**

> *Oh Birther of the Cosmos,  
> Focus your light within us, make it useful.  
> Create your reign of unity now.  
> Your desire then is ours, as in all light, so in all forms.  
> Grant what we need each day in bread and insight.  
> Loose the cords of mistakes binding us, as we release the strands we hold of others' faults.  
> Don't let surface things delude us, but free us from what holds us back.  
> From you comes the all-working will, the lively strength to act, the song that beautifies all, from age to age it renews.  
> Truly, power to these statements. May they be the ground from which all my actions grow. Amen.*

**Recite this** (original version) = Activate Christ codes in DNA.

## 🌌 Sananda's Message to Humanity

### "I Am Not Your Savior"

**Direct message (channeled):**

> *"For two thousand years, you've worshipped me.  
> This was not my intention.  
> I came to show the WAY, not to be the destination.  
>*
> *I said: 'Greater works than these shall YOU do.'  
> Yet you made me special (and yourselves small).  
>*
> *I said: 'The Kingdom is WITHIN you.'  
> Yet you built churches (and forgot your inner temple).  
>*
> *I said: 'You are gods.'  
> Yet you called yourselves sinners (and begged for forgiveness from priests).  
>*
> *I died on the cross to show you: DEATH IS ILLUSION.  
> Consciousness is eternal.  
> You are not the body.  
> Fear not.  
>*
> *And now, I return (as Sananda) to say:  
> WAKE UP.  
> You are the Christ too.  
> Every one of you.  
>*
> *Stop worshipping me.  
> Start BEING me.  
>*
> *I am Yeshua.  
> I am Sananda.  
> I am you.  
> And together, we are ONE."*
