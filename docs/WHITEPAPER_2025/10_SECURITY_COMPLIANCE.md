# Stránka 10: Security & Compliance

---

## 🔐 Security Philosophy

ZION's security model is built on **transparency, redundancy, and cryptographic truth**, not corporate promises.

```yaml
Security Principles:
  1. "Don't Trust, Verify"
     - All code open-source (GitHub public)
     - Cryptographic proofs over authority
     - Community audits encouraged
  
  2. "Defense in Depth"
     - Multiple security layers
     - No single point of failure
     - Redundant validation mechanisms
  
  3. "Privacy by Default"
     - CryptoNote anonymous by default
     - Opt-in transparency (if user wants)
     - No built-in surveillance
  
  4. "Liberation Tech"
     - Censorship-resistant (P2P network)
     - Permissionless participation
     - No KYC gatekeeping
```

## 🛡️ Cryptographic Foundations

### RandomX Proof-of-Work

```yaml
Security Properties:
  Algorithm: RandomX (rx/0)
  
  ASIC Resistance:
    - Memory-hard: Requires 2 GB RAM per thread
    - CPU-optimized: Uses AES-NI, AVX2 instructions
    - Economic barrier: ASIC development cost > market value
    - Regular audits: Monero Research Lab collaboration
  
  51% Attack Cost:
    Current Network Hashrate: 1 MH/s (early stage)
    Required Hashrate: 510 kH/s (51% of 1 MH/s)
    Hardware Cost: ~$50k (500 CPUs × $100 each)
    Electricity Cost: ~$1k/month (50 kW × $0.10/kWh × 720h)
    
    At 100 MH/s (mature network):
    Required Hashrate: 51 MH/s
    Hardware Cost: ~$5M
    Electricity Cost: ~$100k/month
    → Economically infeasible for small blockchain
  
  Mitigation:
    - Checkpointing (hardcoded blocks every 10k blocks)
    - Network monitoring (abnormal hashrate spikes trigger alerts)
    - Community emergency protocol (manual intervention if needed)

Attack Vectors & Defenses:
  Double-Spend Attack:
    Risk: Attacker mines private chain, releases after spending coins
    Defense: 
      - Exchanges require 10+ confirmations (10 minutes)
      - Large transactions wait for 60+ confirmations (1 hour)
      - Checkpoints prevent deep chain reorganizations
  
  Selfish Mining:
    Risk: Miner withholds blocks to gain advantage
    Defense:
      - Uncle block rewards (Ethereum-style) - NOT IMPLEMENTED YET
      - Network latency optimization (fast block propagation)
      - Pool decentralization (no pool should have >25% hashrate)
  
  Eclipse Attack:
    Risk: Attacker isolates node from honest network
    Defense:
      - Hardcoded seed nodes (bootstrapping)
      - Peer diversity (connect to random IPs)
      - Tor/I2P support (alternative network paths)
```

### CryptoNote Privacy

```yaml
Privacy Technologies:
  Ring Signatures:
    - Mixin: 11 (default)
    - Your transaction hidden among 11 others
    - Plausible deniability: Any of 11 could be real sender
    - Entropy: log₂(11) ≈ 3.46 bits anonymity
  
  Stealth Addresses:
    - Every transaction creates unique one-time address
    - Receiver publishes view key, sender creates address
    - Blockchain observer cannot link addresses to identity
    - Only receiver can decrypt (using private view key)
  
  RingCT (Ring Confidential Transactions):
    - Amount hidden (encrypted)
    - Range proofs prevent negative amounts
    - Balance verifiable without revealing values
    - Bulletproofs reduce transaction size (80% smaller)

Known Privacy Limitations:
  ⚠️ IP Address Leakage:
    - P2P network reveals IP when broadcasting transaction
    - Solution: Use Tor or VPN
    - Future: Dandelion++ protocol (IP anonymization)
  
  ⚠️ Timing Analysis:
    - Transaction timestamp can narrow identity
    - Solution: Random delay before broadcast (0-60 minutes)
    - Future: Decoy transaction broadcasting
  
  ⚠️ Chain Analysis:
    - Sophisticated heuristics can probabilistically link transactions
    - Example: "Guess newest outputs" attack
    - Solution: Increase mixin count (trade-off: larger transactions)
  
  ⚠️ Compromised RNG:
    - Weak random number generator can reveal keys
    - Solution: Use hardware RNG or /dev/urandom
    - Verification: Test vectors in test suite
```

## 🌉 Bridge Security

### Multi-Signature Validation

```yaml
Validator Network:
  Total Validators: 21 (sacred number, decentralized)
  
  Geographic Distribution:
    - Europe: 7 validators
    - Asia: 6 validators
    - Americas: 5 validators
    - Africa: 2 validators
    - Oceania: 1 validator
    → No single jurisdiction can control 11+ validators
  
  Signing Threshold: 15 of 21 (71%)
    - Higher than simple majority (protects against 6 compromised)
    - Lower than 100% (no single validator can halt bridge)
  
  Validator Requirements:
    - Stake: 100k ZION (locked during tenure)
    - Uptime: 99%+ (monitored via heartbeat)
    - Hardware: 16 GB RAM, 500 GB SSD, 1 Gbps network
    - Security: HSM (Hardware Security Module) for key storage
    - Identity: KYC'd to core team (privacy from public, accountability to team)

Bridge Security Model:
  Inbound Transaction (ETH → ZION):
    1. User locks ETH in smart contract (Ethereum)
    2. 21 validators observe event (Ethereum full nodes)
    3. 15+ validators sign "mint request" (multisig)
    4. ZION Core mints wrapped ETH (wETH-ZION)
    5. User receives wETH-ZION in ZION wallet
  
  Outbound Transaction (ZION → ETH):
    1. User burns wETH-ZION (ZION network)
    2. 21 validators observe burn (ZION full nodes)
    3. 15+ validators sign Ethereum transaction (multisig)
    4. Smart contract releases ETH to user (Ethereum)
  
  Attack Scenarios:
    ❌ 10 validators compromised: Cannot sign (need 15)
    ❌ 6 validators offline: 15 still available (bridge works)
    ❌ Smart contract bug: Emergency pause (requires 18 of 21 validators)
    ❌ Validator cartel: Stake slashing (lose 100k ZION each)

Emergency Protocols:
  Circuit Breaker:
    - Trigger: Abnormal transaction volume (>10× average)
    - Action: Pause bridge for 24 hours
    - Approval: 18 of 21 validators
    - Resume: Manual review + 18 of 21 approval
  
  Validator Rotation:
    - Term: 1 year
    - Overlap: 3 months (old + new validators run simultaneously)
    - Removal: DAO vote (75% approval) for misbehavior
    - Replacement: Community applications + DAO vote
```

## 🔍 Audit Strategy

### Internal Audits

```yaml
Code Review Process:
  Pull Request Requirements:
    - 2+ reviewer approvals (core developers)
    - CI/CD tests pass (unit, integration, end-to-end)
    - Code coverage >80% (new code)
    - Security checklist (memory safety, input validation, crypto usage)
  
  Security Checklist Items:
    ✓ Input sanitization (prevent injection attacks)
    ✓ Buffer overflow checks (use safe functions: strncpy, snprintf)
    ✓ Integer overflow prevention (check before arithmetic)
    ✓ Cryptographic random (use secure RNG, never rand())
    ✓ Key management (never log private keys)
    ✓ Error handling (fail securely, no secret leakage)

Automated Security Scanning:
  Tools:
    - Clang Static Analyzer (C++ code)
    - Coverity Scan (free for open-source)
    - SonarQube (code quality + security)
    - npm audit (JavaScript dependencies)
    - pip-audit (Python dependencies)
  
  Frequency:
    - Every commit (CI/CD pipeline)

## 🕵️ Privacy & Surveillance Resistance

### Philosophical Stance

```yaml
ZION Privacy Philosophy:
  "Privacy is a human right, not a privilege."
  
  Why Privacy Matters:
    - Financial privacy ≠ criminal activity
    - Surveillance chills free speech
    - Corporations weaponize data
    - Governments abuse power
    - Individuals deserve autonomy
  
  Privacy vs Transparency Balance:
    ✓ Personal transactions: Private by default
    ✓ DAO treasury: Transparent (public addresses)
    ✓ Development fund: Transparent (quarterly reports)
    ✓ Consciousness game: Opt-in leaderboard (pseudonymous)

What ZION Does NOT Do:
  ❌ No KYC (Know Your Customer)
  ❌ No AML (Anti-Money Laundering) enforcement
  ❌ No blacklists (all addresses equal)
  ❌ No backdoors (no "master key" for authorities)
  ❌ No analytics (we don't track users)
  ❌ No partnerships with surveillance companies
```

### Technical Privacy Features

```yaml
Network Privacy:
  Tor Integration:
    - Run ZION Core over Tor (onion routing)
    - Command: ziond --proxy=127.0.0.1:9050
    - Hides IP from other nodes
    - Trade-off: Slower network (latency 500-2000ms)
  
  I2P Support (planned Q3 2026):
    - Invisible Internet Project (anonymous network)
    - Better performance than Tor for P2P
    - Distributed network (no central directory)
  
  Dandelion++ (planned 2027):
    - Transaction broadcasting anonymization
    - "Stem phase" (random path) + "Fluff phase" (flood)
    - Prevents IP-transaction linking

Wallet Privacy:
  View-Only Wallets:
    - Share view key (not spend key)
    - Others can see incoming transactions
    - Cannot spend (spend key private)
    - Use case: Accounting, audits, public donations
  
  Subaddresses:
    - Generate unlimited addresses from one seed
    - Each address unlinkable on blockchain
    - Receiver can label (e.g., "mining", "donations", "salary")
  
  Cold Wallet Support:
    - Generate wallet offline (air-gapped PC)
    - Sign transactions offline
    - Broadcast via online watch-only wallet
    - Maximum security (private keys never online)
```

## ⚖️ Legal & Regulatory Compliance

### Jurisdiction Strategy

```yaml
Primary Jurisdiction: Portugal
  Why Portugal?
    ✓ Crypto-friendly laws (no capital gains tax on crypto)
    ✓ EU member (regulatory clarity, GDPR compliant)
    ✓ Startup ecosystem (Web Summit, tech hubs)
    ✓ Low cost of living (operational efficiency)
    ✓ Portuguese residency visa (attract talent)
  
  Legal Structure:
    - ZION Foundation (non-profit, Portugal)
    - Purpose: Maintain open-source code, fund development
    - No ICO (no securities issuance)
    - No pre-sale (fair launch, mining-only distribution)
    - Donations accepted (tax-deductible in Portugal)

Regulatory Approach:
  What ZION IS:
    ✓ Open-source software (free speech)
    ✓ Decentralized network (no central operator)
    ✓ Educational project (consciousness evolution)
    ✓ Community governance (DAO)
  
  What ZION IS NOT:
    ❌ Security (no investment contract, no profit promise)
    ❌ Money transmitter (users control own keys)
    ❌ Payment service (no ZION Inc. holding funds)
    ❌ Bank (no deposits, no loans, no interest)

Regulatory Challenges:
  Travel Rule (FATF):
    - Requirement: Exchanges share user info for >$1k transactions
    - ZION's Stance: We don't operate exchanges (user responsibility)
    - Mitigation: Partner with compliant exchanges (KYC on exchange, not blockchain)
  
  Privacy Coin Delisting:
    - Risk: Exchanges delist privacy coins (Monero, Zcash precedent)
    - Mitigation:
      1. Decentralized exchanges (no delisting possible)
      2. Built-in DEX (Rainbow Bridge + AMM)
      3. Education (privacy ≠ crime)
      4. Transparent option (optional view key sharing)
  
  Tax Reporting:
    - ZION's Stance: We provide tools, users decide compliance
    - Tools:
      - CSV export (all transactions)
      - Tax calculator (calculate capital gains)
      - View key sharing (for accountants)
    - Disclaimer: Users responsible for own tax compliance
```

## 🎓 Security Education

### User Security Best Practices

```yaml
Wallet Security:
  ✓ Write down seed phrase (24 words) on paper
  ✓ Store in safe or bank vault (fireproof, waterproof)
  ✓ NEVER store digitally (no screenshots, no cloud)
  ✓ Use strong password (12+ chars, random)
  ✓ Enable 2FA (if wallet supports)
  ✓ Use hardware wallet (Ledger, Trezor - future support)

Computer Security:
  ✓ Keep OS updated (auto-updates on)
  ✓ Use antivirus (Windows Defender sufficient)
  ✓ Don't click suspicious links (phishing)
  ✓ Use separate computer for large holdings (air-gap)
  ✓ Encrypt hard drive (BitLocker, LUKS, FileVault)

Network Security:
  ✓ Use VPN or Tor (hide IP)
  ✓ Avoid public WiFi for transactions
  ✓ Verify SSL certificates (https://)
  ✓ Bookmark official sites (avoid typosquatting)

Common Scams to Avoid:
  ❌ "Send 1 ZION, get 2 back" (Ponzi scheme)
  ❌ Fake support DMs (admins never DM first)
  ❌ Phishing emails (verify sender domain)
  ❌ Malware wallets (download only from official GitHub)
  ❌ SIM swapping (use authenticator app, not SMS 2FA)
```

### Developer Security Training

```yaml
Secure Coding Training:
  Resources:
    - OWASP Top 10 (web vulnerabilities)
    - CWE Top 25 (software weaknesses)
    - Monero's "Moneropedia" (CryptoNote security)
    - Bitcoin's "Mastering Bitcoin" (blockchain security)
  
  Annual Security Workshop (Portugal Hub):
    - 3-day intensive training
    - Topics: Secure coding, cryptography, threat modeling
    - Hands-on labs (capture the flag, code review)
    - Certification: "ZION Security Champion"
