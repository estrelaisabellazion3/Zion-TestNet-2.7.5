  - Limited to Cosmos ecosystem (not true multi-chain to ETH, Solana, etc.)
  - No built-in privacy (transparent transactions)
  - PoS centralization (whales control network)
```

### ZION Differentiation

```yaml
How ZION is Different:
  ‚úì True Multi-Chain:
    - Cosmos: Only IBC-compatible chains (Cosmos ecosystem)
    - ZION: 7+ chains (Solana, ETH, Stellar, Cardano, Tron, BSC, Polygon)
    ‚Üí ZION bridges ecosystems, not just one family
  
  ‚úì Privacy-First:
