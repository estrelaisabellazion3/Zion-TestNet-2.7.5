## 👥 ZION Community - Multi-Role Ecosystem

ZION není jen blockchain. Je to **živý ekosystém** různých participant rolí, každá s vlastní motivací a přínosem.

---

## ⛏️ Miners - Network Security & Rewards

### Role & Responsibilities

```yaml
What Miners Do:
  - Run XMRig (or compatible miner)
  - Submit shares to pool
  - Find blocks (RandomX PoW)
  - Secure the network (hashrate = security)
  - Earn ZION rewards

Types of Miners:
  Solo Miner:
    - Runs own ZION Core node
    - Mines directly to node (no pool)
    - Keeps 100% of block reward (if finds block)
    - Risk: Might mine for months without finding block
  
  Pool Miner:
    - Connects to mining pool via Stratum
    - Shares rewards proportionally to hashrate
    - Steady income (even with low hashrate)
    - Trade-off: Pool fees (12-27%)
  
  Consciousness Miner:
    - Pool miner + plays consciousness game
    - Levels up (L1 → L9)
    - Earns XP from AI challenges, meditation, community help
    - Gets exponential reward multipliers (up to 15×)
```

### Mining Setup

```bash
# Basic Pool Mining Setup (Ubuntu/Debian)

# 1. Install XMRig
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install git build-essential cmake libuv1-dev libssl-dev libhwloc-dev
git clone https://github.com/xmrig/xmrig.git
cd xmrig
mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
make -j$(nproc)

# 2. Configure for ZION pool
cat > config.json << EOF
{
    "autosave": true,
    "cpu": true,
    "opencl": false,
    "cuda": false,
    "pools": [
        {
            "algo": "rx/0",
            "coin": "ZION",
            "url": "stratum+tcp://91.98.122.165:3333",
            "user": "YOUR_ZION_ADDRESS",
            "pass": "x",
            "keepalive": true,
            "tls": false
        }
    ]
}
EOF

# 3. Start mining
./xmrig --config=config.json

# Expected output:
# [2025-10-10 17:00:00.000]  net      use pool stratum+tcp://91.98.122.165:3333
# [2025-10-10 17:00:01.234]  cpu      use profile rx (6 threads) scratchpad 2048 KB
# [2025-10-10 17:00:02.456]  cpu      READY threads 6/6 (6) huge pages 100% 12/12 memory 12.0 MB
# [2025-10-10 17:00:05.678]  miner    speed 10s/60s/15m 1234.5 1234.2 n/a H/s max 1235.0 H/s
```

### Mining Economics

```yaml
Hardware Investment:
  Budget Setup (<$500):
    - Used desktop PC (i5/i7 4+ cores)
    - Cost: $200-300
    - Hashrate: 1000-2000 H/s
    - Daily ZION: ~15-30 (at 1 MH/s network)
    - ROI: 3-6 months
  
  Mid-Range ($500-1500):
    - AMD Ryzen 5/7 (8-16 cores)
    - Cost: $800-1200
    - Hashrate: 4000-8000 H/s
    - Daily ZION: ~60-120
    - ROI: 2-4 months
  
  High-End ($1500-5000):
    - AMD Threadripper / EPYC (32-64 cores)
    - Cost: $2000-4000
    - Hashrate: 20,000-40,000 H/s
    - Daily ZION: ~300-600
    - ROI: 1-3 months

Operating Costs:
  Electricity:
    - Desktop (100W): $5-15/month (depends on region)
    - Ryzen (150W): $10-25/month
    - Threadripper (280W): $20-50/month
  
  Internet: $20-50/month (any broadband works)
  Cooling: $0-20/month (fans, AC if needed)
  
  Total Monthly: $25-120 depending on setup

Profitability:
  At ZION = $0.01 (early stage):
    - Budget setup: $0.15-0.30/day = $4.50-9/month (break-even or small profit)
    - Mid-range: $0.60-1.20/day = $18-36/month (profitable)
    - High-end: $3-6/day = $90-180/month (very profitable)
  
  At ZION = $0.10 (growth stage):
    - Budget: $1.50-3/day = $45-90/month (very profitable)
    - Mid-range: $6-12/day = $180-360/month (excellent)
    - High-end: $30-60/day = $900-1800/month (amazing)
```
