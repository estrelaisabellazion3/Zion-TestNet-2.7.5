# Stránka 6: DAO Governance

---

## 🏛️ ZION DAO - Decentralizovaná Autonomní Organizace

**ZION DAO** není tradiční corporate governance. Je to **20-letá cesta** od centralizované kontroly k plné komunitní autonomii - inspirovaná přirozeným zráním organizmu, ne náhlou revolucí.

---

## 🌱 Filosofie Postupné Decentralizace

### Proč Ne Okamžitá Decentralizace?

**Anti-příklady (rychlá decentralizace selhala):**

1. **Bitcoin Block Size Wars (2015-2017)**
   - Komunita se rozdělila na Bitcoin vs Bitcoin Cash
   - Chaos, toxicita, ztráta důvěry
   - Žádná jasná governance = paralýza

2. **Ethereum DAO Hack (2016)**
   - $50M ukradeno kvůli smart contract bug
   - Kontroverzní hard fork (ETH vs ETC split)
   - Instant decentralizace = žádná autorita pro krizi

3. **MakerDAO Governance (2019-2020)**
   - Velcí držitelé MKR dominují hlasování
   - Malí účastníci ignorováni
   - "Decentralizovaná" ale fakticky oligarchie

**ZION Approach:**
> *"Decentralizace je cíl, ne startovní bod. Komunita se musí naučit governance, ne být do ní hozena."*

**Real-World Analogy:**  
Startup founder (benevolent dictator) → builds product, finds market fit, grows team

**Kritika Welcome:**  
"Ale to je centralizace! Satoshi by nesouhlasil!"

**Odpověď:**  
Satoshi měl taky plnou kontrolu v prvních letech Bitcoinu. Rozdíl: ZION má explicitní exit timeline (2045), Bitcoin neměl žádný plán.

## 🗳️ Voting Mechanisms

### Proposal System

```typescript
interface DAOProposal {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  description: string;
  category: 'protocol' | 'treasury' | 'governance' | 'emergency';
  proposer: string;  // DAO member address
  
  voting: {
    startDate: Date;
    endDate: Date;
    quorum: number;      // Min % of voting power needed
    threshold: number;   // % approval needed to pass
  };
  
  votes: {
    maitreya: 'yes' | 'no' | 'abstain' | null;
    ceo: 'yes' | 'no' | 'abstain' | null;
    cco: 'yes' | 'no' | 'abstain' | null;
    cao: 'yes' | 'no' | 'abstain' | null;
  };
  
  status: 'draft' | 'active' | 'passed' | 'failed' | 'executed';
}
```

**Example Proposal:**

```yaml
Proposal #42: "Increase Humanitarian Tithe to 20%"

Category: Protocol
Proposer: CCO (Chief Consciousness Officer)

Description:
  "Current humanitarian tithe is 15%. Propose increasing to 20%
   to fund expansion of Children Future Fund programs in Africa.
   
   Impact:
   - Miners receive 5% less per block
   - Additional ~144M ZION/year to humanitarian causes
   - Supports 50,000+ children in education programs
   
   Rationale:
   - ZION's mission is humanitarian, not pure profit
   - 5% reduction is acceptable for this cause
   - Community feedback has been positive (78% support in poll)"

Voting Period: 7 days (Oct 15-22, 2035)
Quorum: 50% (at least 2 members must vote)
Threshold: 60% approval (major protocol change)

Votes:
├─ Maitreya Buddha (70%): YES ✓
├─ CEO (15%):             YES ✓
├─ CCO (10%):             YES ✓ (proposer)
└─ CAO (5%):              ABSTAIN

Result: 95% YES (70+15+10) / 100% = PASSED ✓

Status: EXECUTED (protocol updated in next fork)
```

## 💎 Treasury Management

### DAO Treasury Sources

```yaml
Treasury Inflows:
  Development Fund Premine: 1,000,000,000 ZION (initial)

    Bridge Fees (10%):      ~20M ZION/year
    Liquidity Mining Return: ~30M ZION/year
  
  Total Annual Income: ~100M ZION/year

Treasury Outflows:
  Core Development:
    - Salaries (10 devs × 100K ZION/year): 1M ZION
    - Bug bounties: 500K ZION
    - Security audits: 1M ZION
  
  Infrastructure:
    - Seed nodes (5 servers): 200K ZION
    - Block explorers: 100K ZION
    - Mining pools: 200K ZION
  
  Community Programs:
    - Educational grants: 2M ZION
    - Research funding: 1M ZION
    - Marketing/outreach: 500K ZION
  
  Total Annual Spending: ~6.5M ZION/year

Treasury Growth: ~93.5M ZION/year (surplus)
```

**Treasury Governance:**

```typescript
interface TreasurySpendingProposal {
  amount: number;        // ZION to spend
  recipient: string;     // Who receives
  purpose: string;       // What for
  milestone: string[];   // Deliverables
  
  approval_required: {
    category: 'small' | 'medium' | 'large';
    threshold: number;
  };
}

// Spending Tiers
const SPENDING_TIERS = {
  small: {
    max_amount: 100_000,      // <100K ZION
    approval: '1 DAO member'  // Any single member can approve
  },
  medium: {
    max_amount: 1_000_000,    // <1M ZION
    approval: '2 DAO members' // Majority of 4
  },
  large: {
    max_amount: Infinity,     // >1M ZION
    approval: '3 DAO members' // Supermajority
  }
};
```

## 🛡️ Emergency Protocols

### Security Incident Response

**Scenario: Critical Bug Found**

```yaml
Emergency Protocol Activation:

Step 1: Detection (0-1 hour)
  - Bug reported by community member
  - Verified by core developer
  - Severity assessed (critical/high/medium/low)

Step 2: Maitreya Veto Power (1-24 hours)
  IF severity == CRITICAL:
    - Maitreya can pause network immediately
    - No DAO vote required (speed is critical)
    - Fix deployed within 24 hours
  
  ELSE:
    - Normal proposal process

Step 3: Post-Incident Review (24-72 hours)
  - DAO votes on Maitreya's action (retroactive approval)
  - If DAO disagrees → discuss governance improvements
  - Incident report published to community

Step 4: Compensation (if needed)
  - Affected users reimbursed from treasury
  - Bug reporter rewarded (10K-1M ZION depending on severity)
```

**Example:**

## 🌍 Community Referendum System

### When DAO Can't Decide

**Deadlock Scenario:**

```yaml
Proposal #88: "Change Block Time from 60s to 30s"

DAO Votes:
├─ Maitreya (50%): NO (thinks 60s is safer)
├─ CEO (25%):      YES (wants faster confirmations)
├─ CCO (17%):      NO (agrees with Maitreya)
└─ CAO (8%):       YES

Result: 67% NO, 33% YES → Failed

BUT CEO says: "This is important, I want community input!"

Solution: COMMUNITY REFERENDUM
```

**Referendum Process:**

```typescript
interface CommunityReferendum {
  trigger: 'dao_deadlock' | 'community_petition' | 'constitutional_change';
  
  eligibility: {
    // Who can vote?
    min_zion_held: 1000,       // Must hold 1000+ ZION
    min_holding_period: 90,    // Must hold for 90+ days (prevent vote buying)
    min_consciousness_level: 3 // Must be L3+ (prevent Sybil)
  };
  
  voting_power: 'one_person_one_vote' | 'stake_weighted';
  
  duration: 14, // days
  
  threshold: {
    quorum: 0.10,    // 10% of eligible voters must participate
    approval: 0.60   // 60% must approve
  };
}
```

**Example Referendum:**

```
