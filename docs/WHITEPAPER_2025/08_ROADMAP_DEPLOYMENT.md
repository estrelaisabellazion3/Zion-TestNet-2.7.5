## 🚧 Risks & Mitigation

### Technical Risks

```yaml
Risk 1: Bridge Hack
  Probability: Medium (cross-chain bridges are high-value targets)
  Impact: High ($10M+ loss possible)
  Mitigation:
    - 21 multisig validators (no single point of failure)
    - Security audits (CertiK, Trail of Bits, Quantstamp)
    - Gradual rollout (start with low caps)
    - Bug bounty ($100k max payout)
    - Insurance fund (5% of bridge fees reserved)

Risk 2: RandomX Algorithm Break
  Probability: Low (well-tested in Monero since 2019)
  Impact: High (need emergency fork)
  Mitigation:
    - Monitor Monero community (early warning)
    - Backup algorithm ready (Yescrypt, KawPow)
    - Emergency DAO vote protocol (24h fork if needed)

Risk 3: Network Attack (51%)
  Probability: Low (RandomX is expensive to attack)
  Impact: Medium (double-spend possible)
  Mitigation:
    - High decentralization (encourage home miners)
    - Checkpoint system (prevent deep reorgs)
    - Exchange confirmation requirements (12+ blocks)
```

### Economic Risks

```yaml
Risk 4: Price Volatility
  Probability: High (all crypto is volatile)
  Impact: Medium (user experience affected)
  Mitigation:
    - Stablecoin pairs on DEXs (ZION/USDC, ZION/DAI)
    - Long-term holder incentives (staking, consciousness game)
    - Discourage speculation (education: "ZION is for use, not pump")

Risk 5: Liquidity Crunch
  Probability: Medium (if bridges drain liquidity)
  Impact: Medium (high slippage, poor UX)
  Mitigation:
    - Liquidity mining rewards (100M ZION/year)
    - Treasury provides initial liquidity (10M ZION)
    - Dynamic bridge fees (increase when liquidity low)
```

### Social Risks

```yaml
Risk 6: Community Conflict
  Probability: Medium (crypto communities are contentious)
  Impact: Medium (fork risk, reputation damage)
  Mitigation:
    - Clear governance structure (DAO roadmap)
    - Maitreya as mediator (2025-2045)
    - Transparent decision-making (all votes public)
    - Focus on dharma (shared values reduce conflict)

Risk 7: Regulatory Pressure
  Probability: High (governments cracking down on crypto)
  Impact: High (Portugal Hub could be forced to close)
  Mitigation:
    - Full legal compliance in Portugal (licenses, taxes)
    - No US users (avoid SEC jurisdiction)
    - Privacy by default (hard to censor CryptoNote)
    - Decentralized infrastructure (no single point of control)
```
