# ZION 2.7.1 ASIC-Resistant Blockchain Requirements
# Pure Argon2 mining for maximum decentralization

# Core dependencies
argon2-cffi>=23.1.0        # ASIC-resistant Argon2 password hashing
pycryptodome>=3.19.0       # Cryptographic primitives
cryptography>=41.0.0       # Advanced cryptographic library for wallet encryption
typing-extensions>=4.5.0    # Type hints support

# Development and testing
pytest>=7.4.0              # Testing framework

# Platform-specific notes:
# - macOS: Install via pip (works with Apple Silicon)
# - Linux: Install via pip or system package manager
# - Windows: Install via pip
#
# ASIC Resistance: This setup ensures mining power correlates
# directly with CPU performance, preventing ASIC centralization.
